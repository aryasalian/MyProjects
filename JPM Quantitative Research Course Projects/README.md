## _What is JPM Quantitative Research Course?_
It is a Virtual Experience Program offered by J.P. Morgan & Co. and Forage for gaining insights and real-life-like experience in Quantitative Finance & Research. As a part of this certification, I have made 4 projects which I would like to display here:

### Task 1: Leveraging a predictive time-series model for seasonal data
### Task 2: Developing a commodity-trade contract valuation model
### Task 3: Estimating loan default risk using feature extraction
### Task 4: Quantization/Discretization of FICO score signals mapped onto FICO ratings

Each of the folders associated with each task contains a .csv file that contains the data that the model utilizes, a Jupyter Notebook file containing my approach to the problem, and a Jupyter Notebook file containing the solution that the course administrator came up with. My approach to each task is my independent and unguided work. All of my work contains a code-walkthrough for ease of interpretation.
